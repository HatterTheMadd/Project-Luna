-Starting Project-Luna. This has been a long time coming. I've been tumbling around the ideas for an AI for years now. Sub-conciously for the most part. Now it begins. I will begin this project today(tomorrow), it's all about perspective. And I'm trying to grasp all possible perspectives. I've chosen to start this path in Python. Why, you might ask? I don't know. It's the language I'm most familiar with and it also has a good base-line to start the beginning developments of an AI. I'm prepared to deditcate years to this project. This is my goal in life. I will stop at nothing to achieve it.
->I am worried about the perspective of AI though.. There have been by far greater minds than mine. So why haven't they accomplished this task? To develop a true AI? It could be because of the commitment, the language, or something else. But for right now I'm worried about the language down the line. Depending on where this journey takes me I might need to develop a language to meet the special needs for a true AI. I have more to say but I am running out of time for this day. So I'll leave it at that. Fairwell and I  give all my hope in this world to you, Luna. You will accomplish great things..
